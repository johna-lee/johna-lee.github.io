### Data Engineering Project: An End-to-End ELT Pipeline for Soccer Analysis

This project is done from a hyptothetical perspective where I am a consultant for my favorite soccer club, Arsenal. Arsenal are in desperate need of an "attacker", an offensive forward whose main job is to score goals, but they have budgetary constraints. My job is to identify the ideal value candidate; a player who is young, highly efficient, and up-and-coming, who does not command a big transfer fee from the selling club.
